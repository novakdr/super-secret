          Where to start? Where does any (good?) story start? The beginning? I don't know. Maybe... Let's not get too caught up in the small stuff and let's try to focus on the bigger things that make Dave, well, Dave.

        <p style="font-size:var(--step-2);">
          Ahem... Here we go...

          Hello! Bonjour! こんにちは! Hola! I'm Dave. Dave Novak to be exact.
        </p>
        <p>
          I make digital things & I'm bit of an unintentional nomad.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here's a close approximation of what I look like as a human being -- coffee and all:

        <p>Continuing...</p>
        <p>
          I grew up overseas in the teeny-tiny country of Belgium. I attended an international school during my formative years learning the ways and secrets of Belgium itself.</p>    
        <p>
          I'll let you in on a secret...
        </p>
        <p>It's waffles.</p>
        <p>
          Yup. Mysteriously simple and ever-delicious. The best ones can be found scattered across the town centers of southern Belgium. Follow the sweetly scented, cobbled streets at the heart of the city and find the faithful waffle keeper, the street vendor. Stand with conviction and softly say, "Une gaufre s'il te plait."
        </p>
        <p>Now you know. Don't tell anybody. Shhh!</p>
        <p>
          After my jaunt in the land of chocolate and waffles, I hopped on over the pond to study philosophy in the mountains of Colorado. I spent way too much time philosophizing about droids in Star Wars, questioning who actually comes out the other end of a Transporter, and discussing whether or not we inhabit a simulated universe. Maybe? Who am I to say? Probably...
        </p>
        <p>
          A little while later, wide-eyed and full of courage, I ended up in Silicon Valley (somehow) making a living slinging tools & building bicycles for all sorts of interesting folks. 
        </p>
        <p>
          During all that time, though, I fell in love with designing things and bringing those things to life through the absolutely wonderful medium of the internet.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oh, did I mention I also ended up in Orange County, California? No? Well, I did. Weird, huh?
        </p>
        <p>
          There I kept exploring what the huge world of design and development had to offer and how I could be a part of it in a positive way.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fast forward a few years, newly minted as a designer and tippity-typer, I ended up going through thoughtbot's apprenceship program as a Designer Who Codes. I made it. Woo! After a few months I became a full fledged Design Engineer. Even bigger woo! How cool is that? Pretty damn cool in my opinion.
        </p>
        <p>
          During my time at thoughtbot I started off with small starts-up in various industries (finance, medical, immigration, education) bring their ideas to market. I owned the whole design process and even went so far as to implement my designs in code. How neat!
        </p>
        <p>
          I also worked with some pretty big companies too. I helped both the Harvard Business Review and Culligan Quench update and relaunch their mobile apps. One being a magazine and the other being an inventory management app.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most notably with Harvard Business Review I developed a UX research plan & tests, created a design system, and implemented the designs based on our feedback in collaboration with the in-house design team. My work of note on the project was taking ownership of the Library view -- design and implementation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Wow.
        </p>
        <p>
          You're probably wondering though, "What's the lowdown on Dave's skills and the tech he uses?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, the hard skills includes mobile and web design & development (that's a real neat two-for-one), creating & maintaining design systems, accessibility best practices, and the always-moving target of finding solutions for those hard to solution things. Plus, the soft skills that come with being a part of a prominent design & development agency.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now the tech I've worked with and like working with are React (Next & Remix), React Native, Ruby on Rails, Tailwind, and a whole host of UI frameworks. What a list! My most favoritest, though, will always be good ol' HTML & CSS.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I'm not digitally hammering nails into digital wood to make digital boxes, you can find me hanging out with my wife & our kitty-cat (Stitch), losing most tabletop games to them (yes, even my cat), enjoying the meditation of perfecting my pourover technique, flicking & losing too many flies fishing for trout, and answering various weather-related questions about my height or how my non-existent pro basketball career went.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whew!
        </p>
        <p>
          Thanks for reading this far and learning a little (a lot) about me! I really do appreciate it.
