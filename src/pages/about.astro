          Where to start? Where does any (good) story start? The beginning? I don't know. Maybe... Let's not get too caught up in the small stuff and let's try to focus on the big things that make Dave, well, Dave.
        </p>
        <p style="font-size:var(--step-2);">
          Ahem... Here we go...
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm Dave. Dave Novak to be exact. Surprise!
        </p>
        <p>
          I make digital things & I'm bit of an unintentional nomad...
        </p>
        <p>
          I grew up overseas in the teeny-tiny country of Belgium. I attended an international school during my formative years learning the ways and secrets of Belgium itself.</p>    
        <p>
          I'll let you in on a secret...
        </p>
        <p>It's waffles!</p>
        <p>
          Mysteriously simple and ever-delicious. The best ones can be found scattered across town centers of southern Belgium. Follow the sweetly scented, cobbled streets of the city centers to find the faithful waffle keeper, the street vendor. Stand tall and softly say, "Une gaufre s'il te plait."
        </p>
        <p>Secret spilled. Don't tell anybody. Shhh!</p>
        <p>
          After my jaunt in the land of chocolate and waffles, I hopped on over the pond to study philosophy in the mountains of Colorado. I spent way too much time philosophizing about droids in Star Wars, questioning who actually comes out the other end of a Transporter, and discussing whether or not we inhabit a simulated universe. Maybe? Who am I to say? Probably...
        </p>
        <p>
          A little while later, wide-eyed and full of courage, I ended up in Silicon Valley (somehow) making a living slinging tools & building bicycles for all sorts of interesting folks. 
        </p>
        <p>
          During all that time, though, I fell in love with designing things and bringing those things to life through the absolutely wonderful medium of the internet.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oh, did I mention I also ended up in Orange County, California? No? Well, I did. Weird, huh?
        </p>
        <p>
          There I kept exploring what the huge world of design and development had to offer and how I could be a part of it in a positive way.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fast forward a few years, newly minted as a designer and click-clacker, I ended up going through thoughtbot's apprenceship program as a Designer Who Codes. I made it. Woo! After a few months I became a full fledged Design Engineer. Even bigger woo! How cool is that? Pretty damn cool in my opinion.
        </p>
        <p>
          While there I worked on a whole variety of things. I helped startups get their products to market -- from a seed of an idea to a deliverable piece of software. I've worked with large companies to design and update existing products within their catalogue. Most notably, I was a part of the Harvard Business Review mobile app re-launch. The Library view was my special little guy but I collaborated in the creation and implentation of a design system, UX research, and mobile development. Many duties, many hats.
        <p>
          You're probably wondering though, "What's the lowdown on Dave's skills and the tech he uses?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, the hard skills includes mobile and web design & development (that's a real neat two-for-one), design systems, accessibility best practices, and the always-moving target of finding solutions for those hard to solution things. Plus, the soft skills that come with being on a prominent design & development agency.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now the tech I've worked with and like working with are React (Next & Remix), React Native, Ruby on Rails, Tailwind, and a whole host of UI frameworks. What a list! My forever love, though, will always be good ol' HTML & CSS. I've used all of those in production.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I'm not digitally hammering nails into digital wood to make digital boxes, you can find me hanging out with my wife & our kitty-cat (Stitch), losing most tabletop games to them (yes, even my cat), enjoying the meditation of perfecting my pourover technique, flicking & losing too flies fishing for trout, and answering various weather-related questions about my height or how my non-existent pro basketball career went.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whew!
        </p>
        <p>
          Thanks for reading this far and learning a little (a lot) about me! I really do appreciate it.

          P.S. Enjoy a picture of myself. Problem is I don't currently have one. Instead, enjoy a picture of Special Agent Dale Cooper. We look similar enough... -ish.
