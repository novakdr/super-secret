### Well, you're here early

Uhm... Well... It seems you've found the blog part of my site. A bit early too. How did you find this place? It doesn't even have a domain yet. Doesn't matter. 
Well, jeez, since you're already here, I think you deserve a sneak peek. You know what they say about early birds...

### Sneaky Peek

First, enjoy some art I did a little bit ago as an extra bonus. How nice!

Wasn't that kind of a fun intro and nice to look at? I think so.

It's not all just looking at pixels in these parts. What an adventrure that would be, though... 

I'll tilt the beans a bit here and share some rought plans I have for this here blog thingy. I'll try my best keep to it brief but I know I can get a bit rambly.

Anyway, here's what to expect from this whole... thing:

To quoteth myself:

> A place, a location, a digital cupboard for me to store and share the things I'm working on, the random stuff that finds me, or the odd written bit of thought.
>
> -- <cite>Me, Dave Novak (owner of this place)</cite>

That's pretty straightforward, right? RIGHT?!

Soon-ish, I'm going to try real hard and yank these curtains back on this here site and explain some of the decisions that went into making it. Yeah... that feels right. This whole place is piping hot off the press -- how did you find it again? -- so it feels appropriate to give it some explaining.

Other than that, I think I just want to share some of my thoughts every once in a harvest moon. -- the usual human thing, you know. 

I almost forgot! The structure of these posts will probably evolve over time. Typical... I'm starting out pretty minimal and just sharing some of the music I'm listening to at the moment. I'm toying with the idea of how long these thoughts have been bouncing in the ol' noggin. Most likely and most probably I'll just start out with what I'm listening to while I'm writing these meanderings. What a deal, I know! Maybe it'll stir something up in the reader as it did for me. Who knows. That would be nice.

Maybe I'll even talk about this fella and its time in the web design sun:

Maybe...
