### Welcome 환영 Bienvenido!

A hearty and most gracious welcome to the un-official, official launch of the very first post -- ignore the pre-post -- on this most strange of writing spaces on the web. (*Poppers & confetti go off all over. Shards fall from above. The roof is caving in.*)

Yes, yes, pleasantries aside, here's a good pat on the back and a big "thanks for being here." This is actually the first official post-launch post on this here Odds & Ends collection gatherer.

I promised I'd peel back the curtain (*loud screaching*) for this site and talk a little bit about it. At least, I'd try my best. Let's dive right in...

### Most prosperous beginnings

Where to start? With an idea? Well, it was less of an idea and more of a necessity to make this thing. See, my little corner of the web hadn't been updated in some time (years even) and was in need of a pretty decent update.

I've always had a good swarm of ideas, leanings, pullings bouncing around the ol' meat canteloupe up top for the better part of a few years now, but never truly committed to one idea over the other until the beginning of this new year.

I decided on a few things that I kinda settled on on how this site wanted to look -- how decisive. I knew I wanted big type (big bois), simple color palette, and a little hint of funk.

I ended up putting some hard constraints on myself to accomplish this mission (it's not to the moon, thankfully): I wanted it (pretty much) designed in a day, fully functional (visitable?) within a couple, hand rolled (I wanted to code it myself), and, most importantly, it had to be simple for me update and for the friends to visit.


### The web as my canvas

We'll get the layout out of the way real quick. It's super simple: one single column for everything. Interchanging stuff is super straight forward -- things slot in and out real nicely. Plus, I had some <a href="https://every-layout.dev/" class="link" style="--hover-bg-color: var(--color-dark);--hover-text-color: var(--color-light);">Every Layout</a>, well, layouts already in mind while making this. Again, this needed to be designed and implemented as quickly as possible.

</figure>

As you can see: big type is a big theme all over the iterations. What I decided on for the display font, and to be the real star of the show, was this old (not really) typeface that I've had kicking around my desktop for a while called Jaapokki. I think it's an asbolutely wonderful typeface. It's got some weird stuff going on, like the letter spacing being super tight on some characters, but it has so much personality that I can't help but really enjoy looking at it. I think it's a typeface worthy of the center stage. I think it drives a lot of character of this site. Inconsolata is the body font. I just like it. It looks cool and it's usually a default for me.

Take a look at the palettes too -- very minimal, not overwhelming. The colors were inspired by stuff around my apartment. Junk to some but wonderful color inspiration for me. To each their own, I say.

Eyeballs, eyeballs, eyeballs... What can I say? They've intrigued humans (and other little critters) since time immemorial. They look witchy and add a little splash of mysteriousness, I think. Or who cares. They look nice and I made them.

The initial idea was done in Figma but I did a lot of designing in the browser. It's just a little easier that way for me, especially if there's a decent outline for me to follow. Which I did or at least it was my idea. So there's that. Good job, Dave!

### The tech

Simplicity at its finest: I went with <a href="https://astro.build" class="link" style="--hover-bg-color: var(--color-dark);--hover-text-color: var(--color-light);">Astro</a>. This framework has been on my radar for a good while now. I'm an Eleventy person but I never really got fully inmeshed with it. Astro was the new kid on the block and fit conventions I was used to. I wanted to code this bad boy with good ol' simple web technologies (HTML & CSS) with a sprinkle of JS to tickle that itch every once in a while.

That's it. It has easy blogging capabilities (seen here, right now) and it's super easy to update. Huzzah! +1 to Astro.

### Crystal ball

What does the future hold, tall one? Oh, I see many a thing in store for this place. Consider this an MVP, v1, a first pass, or whatever. There's some code cleanup that this puppy could really use: organize the CSS a little bit better, componentize things that could be components, and refactor my wee design system a tad. I'd like to use elements of this as a boilerplate of some sort for future projects, so nailing that little design system would be nice and probably top priority. Oh, I can't believe I almost forgot, but images. I ain't taking advantage of what Astro has to offer and their just sitting there probably all huge and stuff. That's definitely top of list too.

I'm designing this out in the open so things will most definitely get really funky and fucked. We're going through this together, so, you know, I understand. Anyways, adding some bells and whistles (animations or what have you) are also maybe top(ish) priorities too. Jeez, Dave. Get your priorities straight.

Thanks and catch ya around!
