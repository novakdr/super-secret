### Welcome 환영 Bienvenido!

A hearty and most gracious welcome to the un-official, official launch of the very first post -- ignore the pre-post -- on this most strange of writing spaces on the web. (*poppers & confetti go off all over, shards fall from above*)

Yes, yes, pleasantries aside, here's a good pat on the back and a "thanks for being here" to boot. This is actually the first official post-launch post on this here Odds & Ends collection gatherer.

I promised I'd peel back the curtain (*loud screaching*) for this site and talk a little bit about it. Let's dive right in.

### The beginning(s)

Where to start? With an idea? Well, it was less of an idea and more of a necessity to make this thing. My little corner of the web hadn't been updated in some time (years) and was in need of a pretty decent update. So, we know that this thing had to be updated but what was the plan?

I've always had a bevy of ideas, leanings, pullings bouncing around the ol' meat canteloupe up top for the better part of a few years, but never truly committed to one idea over the other until the start of this new year. 

I put some hard constraints on myself: I want it (pretty much) designed in a day, fully functional (visitable?) within a couple, hand rolled (I wanted to code it myself), and, most importantly, it had to be simple.
