# So secret

Well, well, well... It looks like you found my super-secret-not-secret-lair. Congrats! * a slow soft clap fills the digital air *

I guess this means that it's not no secret then.

## What is this then?

This is my little space on the web. It's my personal site. Maybe even a boilerplate of sorts. At least it can be for now until it inevitably gets replaced. How typical.

## That's all?

Yup, pretty much. I mean, this is my little place where fun is to be had, experiments to be done, and to share whatever I stumbled upon.

I'm building this out in the open. Things will change. Things will get weird. At least, I very much hope so.

## Thanks

Honestly, thanks for stopping by. Interesting you'd rest up here a second. Appreciate it nonetheless. Don't be a stranger and [reach out to me](mailto:novakdr23@gmail.com) about anything.
